*What’s This All About?*

This is a learning agent trying to find the best way to move across a dangerous grid full of cliffs. We train this agent using something called Q-learning, which is a type of Reinforcement Learning — a way for computers to learn from experience, like how we learn by trying things and seeing what works best.

*The Game: Cliff Walking*

Imagine a grid, like a game board with 4 rows and 12 columns.

* Start (S): The agent starts at the bottom-left corner.
* Goal (G): The agent wants to reach the bottom-right corner.
* Cliff (\*): If the agent steps into the middle area (between Start and Goal), it falls off the cliff and loses points.
* Agent (A): This is where the agent is now.

Here’s a visual idea of the grid:
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
S * * * * * * * * * * G

*Setup and Tools*

We use:

* gym: a Python tool that gives us game environments like this one.
* numpy: helps with numbers and calculations.
* matplotlib: for drawing plots to see how well the agent is doing.
* time and IPython: used for controlling the display.

*Key Terms*

* States: Places the agent can be (like squares on the grid).
* Actions: Choices the agent can make — UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
* Rewards: Points the agent gets:

  * -100 for falling off a cliff,
  * 0 for normal steps,
  * 100 (hypothetical) for reaching the goal.

*What Is Q-learning?*

Q-learning helps the agent learn how valuable each action is from each position. The agent keeps a table (called the Q-table) where it stores this knowledge.

The agent learns using:

* alpha (α): Learning rate – how much it learns from each experience.
* gamma (γ): Discount factor – how much it values future rewards.
* epsilon (ε): Exploration chance – sometimes it tries random moves to explore new paths.

*What Happens During Training?*

We train the agent for 5000 episodes - Like practice rounds.

For each episode:

1. Start at 'S'.
2. Keep moving until it reaches 'G' or falls into a cliff.
3. Use Q-learning to update the Q-table:

   * If the move was good, increase the Q-value.
   * If it was bad (like falling), reduce the Q-value.

The agent starts by guessing, but over time it learns what actions lead to better rewards.

*How Do We Track Learning?*

We use plots to show:

* Rewards per episode: How well it’s doing over time.
* Episode lengths: How long it takes to finish each episode.

We also keep track of the shortest and safest paths it finds (called optimal paths).

*How Does the Agent Decide What to Do?*

At every step:

* With a small chance (ε = 0.1), it explores (tries something random).
* Otherwise, it exploits what it knows (picks the best move so far).

*What Happens During Evaluation?*

After training:

1. We run the agent 5 more times (called evaluation episodes) using only its learned Q-table (no more guessing).
2. It moves step-by-step, choosing the best moves it has learned.
3. We show the grid at each step so we can watch the agent think and act.

At the end of each episode, we check:

* How many steps it took.
* How many points it got.
* Whether it followed one of the best paths found during training.

*What Are Features in the Code?*

* The grid is printed with the agent's position and past moves.
* The Q-values (the agent's "thoughts") are printed at each step.
* The learning curves are smoothed to see progress clearly.
* The code highlights "milestone" episodes (every 100) for insight.

*Sample Output Examples*

During training:
Episode: 100/5000, Steps: 20, Reward: -20.00, Epsilon: 0.1000
Found 1 optimal paths of length 14

During evaluation:
Evaluation Episode 1 finished.
Total Reward: -13, Path Length: 15
Path matches a training optimal path: Yes
